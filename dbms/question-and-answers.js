/* Question 1: What is DBMS
    DBMS provides us an interface or tool for performing different operations such as the creation of a database,
    inserting data into it, deleting data from it, updating the data, etc. DBMS is a software in which data is stored
    in a more secure way as compared to the file-based system.

    A DBMS system helps a user to overcome problems like data inconsistency, data redundancy, etc. in a database and
    makes it more convenient and organized to use it.

 */

/* Question 2: Difference between DBMS and File System
    A file-based system and a database system are two different approaches to managing and organizing data.

    1. Data Structure:
        - In a file-based system, data is stored in files or folders. Each file is typically specific to a particular
        application and contains data relevant to that application.
        - In a database system, data is organized in a structured manner using tables. The relational model is a widely
        used approach, where data is stored in rows and columns.
    2. Data Retrieval and Manipulation:
        - Retrieving and manipulating data in a file-based system often involves custom programming for each
        application.
        - Database systems use a standardized query language such as SQL (Structured Query Language) for data retrieval
        and manipulation.
    3. Scalability and Maintenance:
        - Maintenance tasks, such as adding new features or modifying existing ones, may require significant effort and
        can be error-prone.
        - Maintenance tasks are more straightforward in a database system, as changes can be made to the database
        schema without affecting the entire application.

/* Question 3: Differentiate between DBMS and RDBMS
DBMS                                                        RDMS
- DBMS stores data as file.                                 - RDBMS stores data in tabular form.
- Data elements need to access individually.                - Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.
- No relationship between data.                             - Data is stored in the form of tables which are related to
                                                            each other.
- Normalization is not present.                             - Normalization is present.
- Data redundancy is common in this model.	                - Keys and indexes do not allow Data redundancy.
- It is used for small organization and deal with small     - It is used to handle large amount of data.
data.
- Data fetching is slower for the large amount of data.     - Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.
- It stores data in either a navigational or hierarchical   - It uses a tabular structure where the headers are the
form.                                                         column names, and the rows contain corresponding values.


 */

/* Question 4: What is Database
    A Database is a logical, consistent and organized collection of data that it can easily be accessed, managed and
    updated.
    Database mostly consists of the objects (tables), and tables include of the records and fields. Fields are the
    basic units of data storage, which contain the information about a particular aspect or attribute of the entity
    described by the database. DBMS is used for extraction of data from the database in the form of the queries.

 */

/* Question 5: What is Database System
    The collection of database and DBMS software together is known as a database system. Through the database system,
    we can perform many activities such as-
    The data can be stored in the database with ease, and there are no issues of data redundancy and data inconsistency.

 */



/* Notes:
    - Data Redundancy: Data redundancy is when multiple copies of the same information are stored in more than one place
    at a time.

    - Normalisation: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. It includes creating tables and
    establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make
    the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.
