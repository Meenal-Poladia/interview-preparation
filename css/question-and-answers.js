/* Question 5: What is a CSS Preprocessor? What are Sass, Less, and Stylus? Why do people use them?
    CSS preprocessor is a tool used to enhance the basic functionality and let us use the complex logical syntax such
    as variables, functions, mixins, and code nesting within vanilla CSS scripts themselves.

        1. Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) uses .sass extension. It is used for indentation; it doesnâ€™t use
        semicolons or curly brackets.
        2. Less (Leener Stylesheets) uses .less extension. It is easy to add to any JavaScript Project by using NPM or
        less.js file. Here, @ is used to define the variables.
        3. Stylus provides great flexibility in writing syntax. It is able to use native CSS as well as the exclusion of
        brackets, colons, and semicolons. There is no need to use @ or $ to define the variables.
    People use SASS, LESS, and Stylus in order to extend the basic functionality of vanilla CSS.

/* Question 6: Difference between reset vs normalize CSS? How do they differ
    1. Reset CSS is used to remove all built-in styles in the browser such as paddings, margins, and font sizes, and
    can be reset using all the elements.
    2. Normalize CSS is used to make all built-in styles in the browser consistent and correct bugs as per varying
    browsers.
