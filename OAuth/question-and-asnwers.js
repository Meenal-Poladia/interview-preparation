/* Question 1: What is OAuth
    Certainly! Imagine you have a magical cookie jar, and you want to share some cookies with your friends, but you
    don't want them to take the whole jar. So, you decide to give them a special cookie pass that only works for a
    short time and only lets them take a few cookies.

    In the same way, when you use OAuth, you have some online information (like your pictures or posts), and you want
    to share it with a website or app. Instead of giving them your password, which is like giving away the whole
    cookie jar, OAuth lets you give them a special pass (called a token) that only works for a little while and only
    lets them see or use certain parts of your information. This way, you can share what you want without giving away
    your entire online "cookie jar" or secrets!

    OAuth, an open-standard authorization protocol, allows third-party services to use user data without exposing their
    credentials. It solves the problem of sharing access while maintaining security and privacy. Users can grant
    websites or applications (clients) access to their information on other websites (providers) but without giving
    them passwords. OAuth achieves this by providing tokens instead of actual credentials. These tokens provide
    specific permissions making it a safer method for both users and main servers.

/* Question 2: Explain the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow
    The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow involves the following steps:
        - The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
        - The resource owner grants authorization.
        - The client receives an authorization grant.
        - The client requests an access token using the authorization grant.
        - The authorization server validates the authorization grant and issues an access token.

 */

/* Question 3: What is the purpose of an OAuth refresh token
    A refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires. It
    allows the client to request new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

 */

/* Question 4: Explain the role of Access Token and ID Token in OAuth 2.0
    An access token is a credential that represents the authorization granted to a client. It is used by the client to
    access protected resources. On the other hand, an ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains identity
    information about the authenticated user. It provides information such as the user's unique identifier and
    authentication timestamp.

 */

/* Question 5: How does OAuth handle authentication and authorization
    OAuth, an open standard for access delegation, uses tokens to handle authentication and authorization. It starts
    with the client app requesting authorization from the resource owner to access their data. The owner authorizes
    this request and is redirected back to the application with an authorization code. This code is exchanged by the
    client with the authorization server for an access token. The client can now use this token to make requests on
    behalf of the user to the resource server. OAuth does not share password data but instead uses authorization
    tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers.

 */

/* Question 6: How does OAuth differ from OpenID
    OAuth and  OpenID  are all protocols for authentication and authorization. However, they differ in their
    primary use cases and how they function.

    OAuth is primarily an authorization protocol that allows one application to grant another application access to
    its data without sharing passwords. It’s used extensively for API authorizations.

    OpenID, on the other hand, is purely an authentication protocol. It enables users to authenticate using
    co-operating sites (like Google, Yahoo) instead of having different usernames and passwords for each site.

 */

/* Question 7: What are some potential security risks involved with using OAuth, and how could you mitigate them
    OAuth, while beneficial for user convenience and data sharing, presents several security risks.

        1. Phishing attacks are a significant concern as attackers can trick users into granting permissions to
        malicious applications. To mitigate this, developers should implement strict redirect URI validation and
        educate users about the dangers of phishing.

        2. Another risk is token leakage where access tokens might be exposed in browser history or logs. This can be
        mitigated by using short-lived tokens and refresh tokens, which limit the time an attacker has to use a stolen
        token.

        3. Lastly, there’s the risk of inadequate scope limitation leading to over-privileged applications.
        Implementing least privilege principle and granular scopes can reduce potential damage if a token is
        compromised.

 */

/* Question 8: Explain the purpose of the client ID and client secret in the OAuth protocol
    The client ID and secret in OAuth protocol serve as unique identifiers for the application.

    - The client ID is public, used to build login URLs, or included in Javascript source code. It doesn’t need to be
    kept confidential.
    - On the other hand, the client secret must remain confidential. This secret authenticates the identity of the
    application to the server when the app makes requests. Essentially, these two components work together to ensure
    secure communication between the application and the server, preventing unauthorized access.

 */

/* Question 9: Explain the concept of scope in OAuth and its significance in ensuring secure access.
    Scope in OAuth is a mechanism that limits an application’s access to a user’s account. It provides granular
    permissions, allowing the app to only access what it needs and nothing more. This concept is crucial for secure
    access as it prevents over-privileged applications from accessing sensitive data they don’t require.

    For instance, if an app only needs to read a user’s email, the scope would be set to “read:email”, preventing it
    from modifying or deleting emails. By limiting the potential damage in case of a security breach, scope plays a
    pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user data in OAuth.

 */

/* Question 10: How does OAuth support single sign-on (SSO) and why is it beneficial
    OAuth supports single sign-on (SSO) by allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications.
    It does this through a token-based system where the user’s credentials are exchanged for an access token, which is
    then used to authorize requests without requiring re-authentication.

    The benefit of SSO via OAuth lies in its convenience and security. Users only need to remember one set of login
    details, reducing the risk of forgotten passwords or insecure password practices. Additionally, since the user’s
    actual credentials aren’t repeatedly transmitted with each request, there’s less chance of them being intercepted
    or stolen.

    Moreover, it provides control over data sharing as users can choose what information they want to share with
    third-party apps. Also, it reduces the workload on developers as they don’t have to manage and secure user
    credentials themselves.
