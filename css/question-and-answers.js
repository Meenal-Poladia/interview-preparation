/* Question 5: What is a CSS Preprocessor? What are Sass, Less, and Stylus? Why do people use them?
    CSS preprocessor is a tool used to enhance the basic functionality and let us use the complex logical syntax such
    as variables, functions, mixins, and code nesting within vanilla CSS scripts themselves.

        1. Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) uses .sass extension. It is used for indentation; it doesn’t use
        semicolons or curly brackets.
        2. Less (Leener Stylesheets) uses .less extension. It is easy to add to any JavaScript Project by using NPM or
        less.js file. Here, @ is used to define the variables.
        3. Stylus provides great flexibility in writing syntax. It is able to use native CSS as well as the exclusion of
        brackets, colons, and semicolons. There is no need to use @ or $ to define the variables.
    People use SASS, LESS, and Stylus in order to extend the basic functionality of vanilla CSS.

/* Question 6: Difference between reset vs normalize CSS? How do they differ
    1. Reset CSS is used to remove all built-in styles in the browser such as paddings, margins, and font sizes, and
    can be reset using all the elements.
    2. Normalize CSS is used to make all built-in styles in the browser consistent and correct bugs as per varying
    browsers.

 */

/* Question 7: Difference between inline, inline-block, and block
    1. Block Elements are <div> and <p>. They usually start on a new line and can take space for an entire row or width.
    2. Inline elements are <a>, <span>, <strong>, and <img> tags. They don't start on a new line. However, they appear
    on the same line as the content and tags beside them.
    3. Inline block elements have padding and margins and set height and width values. Though, they are similar to
    inline elements.
 */

/* Question 8: Pseudo Classes
    Pseudo-classes are the type of pseudo-elements that don’t exist in a normal document tree. It allows selecting the
    regular elements under certain conditions especially when we try to hover over the link; the anchor tags are :link,
    :visited, :hover, :active, :focus
 */

/* Question 9: What is the CSS Box model and what are its elements
    The CSS box model is used to define the design and layout of elements of CSS.
    The elements are:
        - Margin - It removes the area around the border. It is transparent.
        - Border - It represents the area around the padding
        - Padding - It removes the area around the content. It is transparent.
        - Content - It represents the content like text, images, etc.

 */

/* Question 10: Border box and Content box
    Border-box consists of properties such as content, padding, and the border with respect to height and width.

    However, Content-box is a default value property used for the box-sizing as well as it helps to add border and
    padding to give proper height and width to the box without having a border and padding properties.
