/* Question 1: What is HTML?
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
    applications.

 */

/* Question 2: Purpose of DOCTYPE in HTML?
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration specifies the HTML version being used and helps browsers render the document correctly.

 */

/* Question 3: Semantic elements in HTML
    Semantic elements convey meaning about the structure of the document. Examples include <header>, <nav>, <article>,
    <section>, <footer>, and others.
 */

/* Question 4: Difference between the <script> tag with the async and defer attributes.
    <script async> loads the script asynchronously while the HTML document continues parsing.
    <script defer> defers script execution until after the HTML document has been fully parsed.

 */

/* Question 5: HTML Attributes?
    Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way the tag behaves or is
    displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to add the source from which the image should
    be displayed.

 */

/* Question 6: Void elements in HTML
    Void elements in HTML are tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used to insert images, line breaks, and
    other content that does not require additional information.
