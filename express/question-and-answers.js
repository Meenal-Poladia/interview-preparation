/* Question 1: What is Express.js
    Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add
    helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing;
    it adds helpful utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects; it facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.

 */

/* Question 2: Features of Express.js
    Express is a lightweight, minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, it provides a robust set of
    features for web and mobile applications.

    Few features of the Express.js includes
    1. Routing: Express provides a simple way to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Routes are used to map
    different URLs to specific pieces of code, making it easy to organize your application’s logic.
    2. Middleware: Express uses middleware functions to perform tasks during the request-response cycle. Middleware
    functions have access to the request, response, and the next middleware function.
    3. HTTP Utility Methods: Express mainly used for handling HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This makes
    it easy to define how the application should respond to different types of HTTP requests.
    4. Static File Serving: It can also serve static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of
    built-in express.static middleware.
    5. Security: It includes features and middleware to strengthen the security of your web applications, such as the
    helmet middleware to secure your app.

/* Question 3: How does Express.js differ from Node.js
    Node.js is a runtime for executing JavaScript, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js to simplify
    web development.

 */

/* Question 4: Is Express JS a front-end or a back-end framework
    Express.js is a JavaScript backend framework. It is mainly designed to develop complete web applications and APIs.
    Express is the backend component of the MERN stack which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js.

 */

/* Question 5: Structure of an Express JS application
    The structure of an Express JS application can vary greatly depending on its complexity and the specific needs of
    the project. However, here is a basic approach that is commonly used:

    1. Entry point: This is the starting point of the application where you set up your server, connect to your
    database, add middleware, and define the main routes.
    2. Routes directory: This directory contains files for the app’s routes.
    3. Controllers directory: This directory contains files that define the logic to handle requests for a specific
    route.
    4. Models directory: This directory is used for creating the schema models for the different data.
    5. Middleware directory: This directory contains custom middleware functions that you can use in your routes.
    6. Views directory: If you’re using a templating engine, this directory contains your view templates.
    7. Public directory: This directory contains static files that are served directly by the server such as images, CSS
    files, and JavaScript files.

 */

/* Question 6: Major tools that can be integrated with Express JS
    There are many tools and libraries that can be integrated with Express.js such as:
    - Database tools: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
    - Template Engines: EJS, Pug, Mustache.
    - Authentication libraries: Passport.js.
    - Logging libraries: Morgan, Winston.
    - Validation libraries: Joi, express-validator.
    - ORM libraries: Sequelize, Mongoose.
