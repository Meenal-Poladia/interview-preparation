/* Question 1: What is HTML?

    applications.

 */

 */

 */

/* Question 4: Difference between the <script> tag with the async and defer attributes.
    <script async> loads the script asynchronously while the HTML document continues parsing.
    <script defer> defers script execution until after the HTML document has been fully parsed.

 */

/* Question 5: HTML Attributes?
    Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way the tag behaves or is
    displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to add the source from which the image should
    be displayed.

 */

/* Question 6: Void elements in HTML
    Void elements in HTML are tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used to insert images, line breaks, and
    other content that does not require additional information.

 */

 */

/* Question 8: Difference between an absolute and relative URL
    An absolute URL includes the full web address, the protocol (such as http or https) and the domain name
    (such as www.example.com).

    A relative URL, on the other hand, specifies the location of a resource relative to the current web page.
    For example, a relative URL might include the file path (such as /images/picture.jpg) or the relative path
    (such as ../images/picture.jpg).
 */

/* Question 9: Role of the action attribute in HTML forms
    The action attribute is used to specify the URL of the script or program that will process the data submitted by
    the form. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to the specified URL for processing.

 */

/* Question 10: Key Differences Between LocalStorage And SessionStorage Objects
    The key differences between localStorage and sessionStorage objects are as follows:

    The localStorage object stores the data without an expiry date. However, sessionStorage object stores the data for
    only one session.
    In the case of a localStorage object, data will not delete when the browser window closes. However, the data gets
    deleted if the browser window closes, in the case of sessionStorage objects.
    The data in sessionStorage is accessible only in the current window of the browser. But, the data in the
    localStorage can be shared between multiple windows of the browser.
