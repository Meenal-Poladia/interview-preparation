    What is Javascript?
    JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the
    web. It is a high-level, interpreted language that enables developers to manipulate the DOM.

    Javascript follows the standards set by ECMAScript which makes it standardised to be run across different
    browsers.

    Key Features:
    1. Client side scripting: Allows developers to write code that runs in the browser and interacts with the
    Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate web page elements.
    2. Object Oriented: JavaScript follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, supporting concepts like objects,
    classes and inheritance. However, it is a prototype-based language rather than class-based.
    3. Event Driven: Meaning it can respond to user actions (such as clicks and keyboard inputs) and execute specific
    code in response to those events.
    4. Asynchronous Programming: supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, Promises, and the
    async/await syntax. This is crucial for handling tasks such as fetching data from servers without blocking the
    execution of other code.
    5. Cross-Platform: JavaScript is not limited to web browsers. It can also help to develop server-side development,
    using NodeJs allowing developers to create full-stack applications using a single language.


    Which are the types of operators in javascript?
    1. Arithmetic Operators
    2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
    3. Bitwise Operators
    4. Logical Operators
    5. Assignment Operators
    6. Special Operators


    Which are the datatype in Javascript?
    1. Primitive data type - Bunns
        ■	String - represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
        ■	Number - represents numeric values e.g. 100
        ■	Boolean  - represents boolean value either false or true
        ■	Undefined - represents undefined value
        ■	Null - represents null i.e. no value at all
    2. Non-primitive (reference) data type
        ■	Object - represents instance through which we can access members
        ■	Array - represents group of similar values
        ■	RegExp - represents regular expression


    Difference between undefined and null?
    Null and undefined are primitive data type values. They both are falsy values.

    Undefined means the default value of a variables that are declared but not assigned a value. Function parameters
    that are not provided with a value default to undefined. The typeOf undefined is undefined.

    Null is often explicitly assigned to variables or object properties to signify that they intentionally have no
    value. The typeOf undefined is object.

    If we don’t assign any value to variable javascript automatically assigns it undefined value and if we assign
    a variable as null it means that we are setting the variable empty.


    What is type conversion and type coercion?
    Type conversion is when we manually convert a variable from one data type to another. eg: To manually convert
    strings to numbers, use the Number() constructor

    Type coercion happens whenever an operator is dealing with two values that are of different types.
    In this javascript will automatically convert the data type of another variable to another for comparison. Type
    coercion depends on the operator being used.
    + coerces to string
    > and - and *  and / coerces to number
