/* Question 1: What is Git
    Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. It
    allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage versions, and track changes efficiently.

 */

/* Question 2: What is a version control system (VCS)
    A VCS keeps track of the contributions of the developers working as a team on the projects. They maintain the
    history of code changes done and with project evolution, it gives an upper hand to the developers to introduce
    new code, fixes bugs, and run tests with confidence that their previously working copy could be restored at any
    moment in case things go wrong.

 */

/* Question 3: Explain the difference between Git and GitHub
    Git is the version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
    GitHub adds a social and collaborative layer on top of Git, making it easier for multiple developers to work
    together on a project.

 */

/* Question 4: What is a Git repository
    A Git repository is a folder that contains all the files and version history of a project. It includes a hidden
    folder named ".git" that stores metadata, branches, and the complete history of the project.

 */

/* Question 5: How do you create a new branch in Git
     To create a new branch, you can use the following command:
     -> git checkout -b new-branch-name
