/* Question 1: What is Git
    Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. It
    allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage versions, and track changes efficiently.

 */

/* Question 2: What is a version control system (VCS)
    A VCS keeps track of the contributions of the developers working as a team on the projects. They maintain the
    history of code changes done and with project evolution, it gives an upper hand to the developers to introduce
    new code, fixes bugs, and run tests with confidence that their previously working copy could be restored at any
    moment in case things go wrong.

 */

/* Question 3: Explain the difference between Git and GitHub
    Git is the version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
    GitHub adds a social and collaborative layer on top of Git, making it easier for multiple developers to work
    together on a project.

 */

/* Question 4: What is a Git repository
    A Git repository is a folder that contains all the files and version history of a project. It includes a hidden
    folder named ".git" that stores metadata, branches, and the complete history of the project.

 */

/* Question 5: How do you create a new branch in Git
     To create a new branch, you can use the following command:
     -> git checkout -b new-branch-name

 */

/* Question 6: Explain the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch.'
    git pull fetches changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into the current branch.

    On the other hand, git fetch fetches changes but doesn't automatically merge them, allowing you to review changes
    before merging.

 */

/* Question 7: What is a Git merge conflict, and how do you resolve it
    A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. To resolve it, you
    need to manually edit the conflicting files, choose which changes to keep, and then commit the resolved files.

 */

/* Question 8: How do you revert a commit in Git
    To revert the last commit, you can use: git revert HEAD

    If you want to revert a specific commit, you can use: git revert <commit-hash>

 */

/* Question 9: Explain the purpose of Git's 'stash' command
    The git stash command is used to save changes that are not ready to be committed but need to be set aside
    temporarily. It allows you to switch to another branch or perform other operations without committing the current
    changes.

 */

/* Question 10: What is the Gitflow workflow
    Gitflow is a branching model that defines specific branches and their purposes. It typically includes branches
    like master for production releases, develop for ongoing development, and feature branches for new features. It
    helps organize the development process in larger projects.
