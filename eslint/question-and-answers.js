/* Question 1: What is a linter
    Linters highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your source code, which often times helps you identify and
    correct subtle programming errors or unconventional coding practices that can lead to errors.

 */

/* Question 2: What is ESLint, and why is it used
     ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code. It is used to
     enforce coding style consistency, catch common programming errors, and maintain a high code quality standard in a
     codebase.

 */

/* Question 3: Explain the concept of ESLint rules
    ESLint rules define the coding style and guidelines that ESLint enforces. Rules can be configured in the .eslintrc
    file and can cover areas such as indentation, variable naming, syntax preferences, and more.

 */

/* Question 4: What is the purpose of the .eslintignore file
    The .eslintignore file is used to specify files and directories that ESLint should ignore during linting. It
    allows you to exclude certain files or patterns from being analyzed.

 */

/* Question 5: How do you fix ESLint errors automatically
    ESLint can automatically fix certain types of errors using the --fix option.

    For example:
    eslint --fix file.js
