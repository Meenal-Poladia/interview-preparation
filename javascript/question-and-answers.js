    What is Javascript?
    JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the
    web. It is a high-level, interpreted language that enables developers to manipulate the DOM.

    Javascript follows the standards set by ECMAScript which makes it standardised to be run across different
    browsers.

    Key Features:
    1. Client side scripting: Allows developers to write code that runs in the browser and interacts with the
    Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate web page elements.
    2. Object Oriented: JavaScript follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, supporting concepts like objects,
    classes and inheritance. However, it is a prototype-based language rather than class-based.
    3. Event Driven: Meaning it can respond to user actions (such as clicks and keyboard inputs) and execute specific
    code in response to those events.
    4. Asynchronous Programming: supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, Promises, and the
    async/await syntax. This is crucial for handling tasks such as fetching data from servers without blocking the
    execution of other code.
    5. Cross-Platform: JavaScript is not limited to web browsers. It can also help to develop server-side development,
    using NodeJs allowing developers to create full-stack applications using a single language.

    Which are the datatype in Javascript?
    1. Primitive data type - Bunns
        ■	String - represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
        ■	Number - represents numeric values e.g. 100
        ■	Boolean  - represents boolean value either false or true
        ■	Undefined - represents undefined value
        ■	Null - represents null i.e. no value at all
    2. Non-primitive (reference) data type
        ■	Object - represents instance through which we can access members
        ■	Array - represents group of similar values
        ■	RegExp - represents regular expression
